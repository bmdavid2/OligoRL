abstract = {Total RNA sequencing has been used to reveal poly(A) and non-poly(A) RNA expression, RNA processing and enhancer activity. To date, no method for full-length total RNA sequencing of single cells has been developed despite the potential of this technology for single-cell biology. Here we describe random displacement amplification sequencing (RamDA-seq), the first full-length total RNA-sequencing method for single cells. Compared with other methods, RamDA-seq shows high sensitivity to non-poly(A) RNA and near-complete full-length transcript coverage. Using RamDA-seq with differentiation time course samples of mouse embryonic stem cells, we reveal hundreds of dynamically regulated non-poly(A) transcripts, including histone transcripts and long noncoding RNA Neat1. Moreover, RamDA-seq profiles recursive splicing in >300-kb introns. RamDA-seq also detects enhancer RNAs and their cell type-specific activity in single cells. Taken together, we demonstrate that RamDA-seq could help investigate the dynamics of gene expression, RNA-processing events and transcriptional regulation in single cells. Total RNA sequencing has been used to profile poly(A) and non-poly(A) RNA expression, processing and the activity of enhancers. Here the authors develop RamDA-seq, a method for full-length total RNA sequencing in single cells.},

abstract = {The infection process is accompanied by widespread changes in gene expression in both host and pathogen. Here, Vogel and colleagues explore the feasibility of simultaneously analysing the transcriptomes of both host and pathogen using RNA deep-sequencing approaches. A comprehensive understanding of host–pathogen interactions requires a knowledge of the associated gene expression changes in both the pathogen and the host. Traditional, probe-dependent approaches using microarrays or reverse transcription PCR typically require the pathogen and host cells to be physically separated before gene expression analysis. However, the development of the probe-independent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach has begun to revolutionize transcriptomics. Here, we assess the feasibility of taking transcriptomics one step further by performing 'dual RNA-seq', in which gene expression changes in both the pathogen and the host are analysed simultaneously.},

abstract = {Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum results in approximately 1 million annual deaths worldwide, with young children and pregnant mothers at highest risk. Disease severity might be related to parasite virulence factors, but expression profiling studies of parasites to test this hypothesis have been hindered by extensive sequence variation in putative virulence genes and a preponderance of host RNA in clinical samples. We report here the application of RNA sequencing to clinical isolates of P. falciparum, using not-so-random (NSR) primers to successfully exclude human ribosomal RNA and globin transcripts and enrich for parasite transcripts. Using NSR-seq, we confirmed earlier microarray studies showing upregulation of a distinct subset of genes in parasites infecting pregnant women, including that encoding the well-established pregnancy malaria vaccine candidate var2csa. We also describe a subset of parasite transcripts that distinguished parasites infecting children from those infecting pregnant women and confirmed this observation using quantitative real-time PCR and mass spectrometry proteomic analyses. Based on their putative functional properties, we propose that these proteins could have a role in childhood malaria pathogenesis. Our study provides proof of principle that NSR-seq represents an approach that can be used to study clinical isolates of parasites causing severe malaria syndromes as well other blood-borne pathogens and blood-related diseases.},

abstract = {Transcriptome studies based on quantitative sequencing can estimate levels of gene expression by measuring target RNA abundance in sequencing libraries. Sequencing costs are proportional to the total number of sequenced reads, and in order to cover rare RNAs, considerable quantities of abundant and identical reads are needed. This major limitation can be addressed by depleting a proportion of the most abundant sequences from the library. However, such depletion strategies involve either extra handling of the input RNA sample or use of a large number of reverse transcription primers, termed not-so-random (NSR) primers, which are costly to synthesize. Taking advantage of the high tolerance of reverse transcriptase to mis-prime, we found that it is possible to use as few as 40 pseudo-random (PS) reverse transcription primers to decrease the rate of undesirable abundant sequences within a library without affecting the overall transcriptome diversity. PS primers are simple to design and can be used to deplete several undesirable RNAs simultaneously, thus creating a flexible tool for enriching transcriptome libraries for rare transcript sequences.},

We developed a procedure for the preparation of whole transcriptome cDNA libraries depleted of ribosomal RNA from only 1 $\mu$g of total RNA. The method relies on a collection of short, computationally selected oligonucleotides, called 'not-so-random' (NSR) primers, to obtain full-length, strand-specific representation of nonribosomal RNA transcripts.

abstract = {The success of widely used oligonucleotide-based experiments, ranging from PCR to microarray, strongly depends on an accurate design. The design process involves a number of steps, which use specific parameters to produce high quality oligonucleotides. Oli2go is an efficient, user friendly, fully automatedmultiplex oligonucleotide design tool, which performs primer and different hybridization probe designs as well as specificity and cross dimer checks in a single run. The main improvement to existing oligonucleotide design web-tools is that oli2go combines multiple steps in an all-in-one solution, where other web applications only accomplish parts of the whole design workflow. Especially, the oli2go specificity check is not only performed against a single species (e.g. mouse), but against bacteria, viruses, fungi, invertebrates, plants, protozoa, archaea and sequences from whole genome shotgun sequence projects and environmental samples, at once. This allows the design of highly specific oligonucleotides in multiplex applications, which is further assured by performing dimer checks not only on the primers themselves, but in an all-against-all fashion.},

abstract = {DNA oligonucleotides are essential components of a high number of technologies in molecular biology. The key event of each oligonucleotide-based assay is the specific binding between oligonucleotides and their target DNA. However, single-stranded DNA molecules also tend to bind to unintended targets or themselves. The probability of such unspecific binding increases with the complexity of an assay. Therefore, accurate data management and design workflows are necessary to optimize the in-silico design of primers and probes. Important considerations concerning computational infrastructure and run time need to be made for both data management and the design process. Data retrieval, data updates, storage, filtering and analysis are the main parts of a sequence data management system. Each part needs to be well-implemented as the resulting sequences form the basis for the oligonucleotide design. Important key features, such as the oligonucleotide length, melting temperature, secondary structures and primer dimer formation, as well as the specificity, should be considered for the in-silico selection of oligonucleotides. The development of an efficient oligonucleotide design workflow demands the right balance between the precision of the applied computer models, the general expenditure of time, and computational workload. This paper gives an overview of important parameters during the design process, starting from the data retrieval, up to the design parameters for optimized oligonucleotide design.},

abstract = {Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a basic molecular biology technique with a multiplicity of uses, including deoxyribonucleic acid cloning and sequencing, functional analysis of genes, diagnosis of diseases, genotyping and discovery of genetic variants. Reliable primer design is crucial for successful PCR, and for over a decade, the opensource Primer3 software has been widely used for primer design, often in high-throughput genomics applications. It has also been incorporated into numerous publicly available software packages and web services. During this period, we have greatly expanded Primer3's functionality. In this article, we describe Primer3's current capabilities, emphasizing recent improvements. The most notable enhancements incorporate more accurate thermodynamic models in the primer design process, both to improve melting temperature prediction and to reduce the likelihood that primers will form hairpins or dimers. Additional enhancements include more precise control of primer placement- a change motivated partly by opportunities to use whole-genome sequences to improve primer specificity. We also added features to increase ease of use, including the ability to save and re-use parameter settings and the ability to require that individual primers not be used in more than one primer pair. We have made the core code more modular and provided cleaner programming interfaces to further ease integration with other software. These improvements position Primer3 for continued use with genome-scale data in the decade ahead. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {DNA libraries containing random “barcodes” complicate synthetic biology workflows that utilize restriction enzymes since restriction sites can appear inside some barcodes. By removing bases at particular sites in the barcodes, it is possible to create semi-random pools of barcodes that do not contain any restriction sites. The challenge is to remove as few bases as possible to maximize the number of sequences in the pool while ensuring all sequences are free of restriction sites. The authors present CutFree, a computational approach to create pools of random DNA barcodes that lack a pre-defined set of restriction sites. The resulting pools can be inexpensively produced en masse with standard DNA synthesis techniques. CutFree is experimentally validated by blocking digestion of pools of barcodes designed to frequently contain restriction sites. Using CutFree, a pool of 1.3 billion barcodes that are free from recognition sites for 182 commercially available restriction enzymes is designed. CutFree is available as a software package and an online tool (http://jensenlab.net/tools).},

abstract = {Metatranscriptomes generated by pyrosequencing hold significant potential for describing functional processes in complex microbial communities. Meeting this potential requires protocols that maximize mRNA recovery by reducing the relative abundance of ribosomal RNA, as well as systematic comparisons to identify methodological artifacts and test for reproducibility across data sets. Here, we implement a protocol for subtractive hybridization of bacterial rRNA (16S and 23S) that uses sample-specific probes and is applicable across diverse environmental samples. To test this method, rRNA-subtracted and unsubtracted transcriptomes were sequenced (454 FLX technology) from bacterioplankton communities at two depths in the oligotrophic open ocean, yielding 10 data sets representing ∼ 350 Mbp. Subtractive hybridization reduced bacterial rRNA transcript abundance by 40-58%, increasing recovery of non-rRNA sequences up to fourfold (from 12% to 20% of total sequences to 40-49%). In testing this method, we established criteria for detecting sequences replicated artificially via pyrosequencing errors and identified such replicates as a significant component (6-39%) of total pyrosequencing reads. Following replicate removal, statistical comparisons of reference genes (identified via BLASTX to NCBI-nr) between technical replicates and between rRNA-subtracted and unsubtracted samples showed low levels of differential transcript abundance (<0.2% of reference genes). However, gene overlap between data sets was remarkably low, with no two data sets (including duplicate runs from the same pyrosequencing library template) sharing greater than 17% of unique reference genes. These results indicate that pyrosequencing captures a small subset of total mRNA diversity and underscores the importance of reliable rRNA subtraction procedures to enhance sequencing coverage across the functional transcript pool. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

@article{Culviner2020,
abstract = {The profiling of gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has en-abled powerful studies of global transcriptional patterns in all organisms, including bacteria. Because the vast majority of RNA in bacteria is rRNA, it is standard practice to deplete the rRNA from a total RNA sample such that the reads in an RNA-seq experiment derive predominantly from mRNA. One of the most commonly used commercial kits for rRNA depletion, the Ribo-Zero kit from Illumina, was recently discontinued abruptly and for an extended period of time. Here, we report the development of a simple, cost-effective, and robust method for depleting rRNA that can be easily implemented by any lab or facility. We first developed an algorithm for designing biotinylated oligonucleotides that will hybridize tightly and specifically to the 23S, 16S, and 5S rRNAs from any species of interest. Precipitation of these oligo-nucleotides bound to rRNA by magnetic streptavidin-coated beads then depletes rRNA from a complex, total RNA sample such that $\sim$75 to 80% of reads in a typical RNA-seq experiment derive from mRNA. Importantly, we demonstrate a high correlation of RNA abundance or fold change measurements in RNA-seq experiments between our method and the Ribo-Zero kit. Complete details on the methodology are provided, including open-source software for designing oligonucleotides optimized for any bacterial species or community of interest. IMPORTANCE The ability to examine global patterns of gene expression in microbes through RNA sequencing has fundamentally transformed microbiology. However, RNA-seq depends critically on the removal of rRNA from total RNA samples. Other-wise, rRNA would comprise upward of 90% of the reads in a typical RNA-seq experi-ment, limiting the reads coming from mRNA or requiring high total read depth. A commonly used kit for rRNA subtraction from Illumina was recently unavailable for an extended period of time, disrupting routine rRNA depletion. Here, we report the development of a “do-it-yourself” kit for rapid, cost-effective, and robust depletion of rRNA from total RNA. We present an algorithm for designing biotinylated oligonucle-otides that will hybridize to the rRNAs from a target set of species. We then demonstrate that the designed oligonucleotides enable sufficient rRNA depletion to pro-duce RNA-seq data with 75 to 80% of reads coming from mRNA. The methodology presented should enable RNA-seq studies on any species or metagenomic sample of interest.},
